// What type should we expect? *To print a string and also show the value of the variable we set which is Monday.

// Try to print a variable that does not exist
// What should we expect to print in the CLI?

console.log(name); // This showed up as undefined.

// Print "greeting" again
// Will this line run? *This line will NOT run because the previous line is not functionable because it has not been defined within the code.
// If I were to comment this section out like I did the previous one, I would be able to run the last greeting line.
